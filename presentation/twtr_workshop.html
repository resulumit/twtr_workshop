## Who am I?

Resul Umit

- post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oslo

- interested in representation, elections, and parliaments
    - [a recent publication](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1478929920967588):
    Parliamentary communication allowances do not increase electoral turnout or incumbents’ vote share

--

- working with Twitter data
    - [a publication based on Twitter data](https://doi.org/10.1080/13572334.2017.1283166): The voices of Eurosceptic members of parliament (MPs) echo disproportionately louder on Twitter
    
      - 400,000+ tweets from 1,000+ MPs
      - automated classification, using a bag-of-words approach
      - manual validation

---
## The Workshop &amp;mdash; Overview

- Two days, on how to collect, process, and analyse data from Twitter

  - ~200 slides, 75+ exercises
  - support for applications to Twitter, developing real projects

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Designed for researchers with basic knowledge of R programming language

  - does not cover programming with R
      - e.g., writing functions    
&lt;br&gt;
  - existing ability to work with data in R will be very helpful
      - especially while processing and analysing data
      - but not absolutely necessary &amp;mdash; this ability can be developed during and after the workshop as well
        
---
## The Workshop &amp;mdash; Motivation

- Twitter provides attractive opportunities for academic research

  - a simple search for "twitter data" returns 74,000+ results on Google Scholar
     - at the beginning of March 2022

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Research based on Twitter data requires a set of skills 

  - typically, these skills are not part of academic training


---
## The Workshop &amp;mdash; Motivation &amp;mdash; Opportunities

- Popularity of the network

  - about 220 million users, more than half are daily active
  - your subjects are likely Twitter users
     - e.g., for me, members of parliament

---
## The Workshop &amp;mdash; Motivation &amp;mdash; Opportunities

- Popularity of the network

  - about 220 million users, more than three quarters are daily active&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
  - your subjects are likely Twitter users
     - e.g., for me, members of parliament

&lt;br&gt;

- Richness of the data

  - about 500 million tweets per day&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
  - with up to 90 variables for each tweet


.footnote[

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; These statistics are compiled at the end of 2021, by [BusinessOfApps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitter-statistics).

]

---
## The Workshop &amp;mdash; Motivation &amp;mdash; Opportunities

- Popularity of the network

  - about 350 million users, more than half are daily active
  - your subjects are likely Twitter users
     - e.g., for me, members of parliament

&lt;br&gt;

- Richness of the data

  - about 500 million tweets per day
  - with up to 90 variables for each tweet

&lt;br&gt;

- Accessibility of the data

  - most Twitter data are public
     - i.e., relatively few private profiles   
&lt;br&gt;
  - APIs (application programming interfaces) enable programmatic access to Twitter
     - e.g., downloading tweets with R, as opposed to viewing tweets as visualised via browsers

---
## The Workshop &amp;mdash; Motivation &amp;mdash; Challenges

- Research based on Twitter data requires certain skills

  - e.g., availability of API is meaningless for researchers who cannot code yet
  - processing and analysing data are no less challenging without programming skills

--

&lt;br&gt;

- The required skills are often uncovered in the academic training of social scientists

  - e.g., methodology courses
  - but help is available elsewhere, including        
&lt;br&gt;
      - collaboration with researchers with the skills
         - at the cost of sacrificing some control over your research and research agenda   
&lt;br&gt;
      - acquiring the skills through individual effort
         - e.g., workshops such as this one

---
## The Workshop &amp;mdash; Motivation &amp;mdash; Aims

- To provide you with an understanding of what is possible

  - we will cover a large breath of issues, not all of it is for long-term memory
      - hence the slides are designed for self study as well    
&lt;br&gt;
  - awareness of what is possible, `Google`, and perseverance are all you need

--

&lt;br&gt;

- To start you with acquiring and practicing the skills needed 

  - practice with ready-written code
  - start working on a real project

# Part 1. Preliminary Considerations

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Research Questions &amp; Hypotheses

- Ideally, we have one or more research questions, hypotheses

  - developed prior to data collection, analysis
     - based on, e.g., theory, claims, observations   
&lt;br&gt;
  - perhaps, even pre-registered
     - e.g., at [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries)

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Not all questions can be answered with Twitter data

  - see relevant literature for what works, what does not
     - e.g., for political science, the review by &lt;a name=cite-jungherr2016&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Jungherr, 2016](#bib-jungherr2016)) 
        - for public health, the review by &lt;a name=cite-sinnenberg2017&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Sinnenberg, Buttenheim, Padrez, Mancheno, Ungar, and Merchant, 2017](#bib-sinnenberg2017)) 

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Potential Biases

There are at least two potential sources of bias in Twitter data

- sampling

  - Twitter users are not representative of the people out there
     - see, for example, &lt;a name=cite-mellon2017&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Mellon and Prosser, 2017](#bib-mellon2017))   
&lt;br&gt;
  - Tweeting behaviour has a strategic component 
     - see, for example, &lt;a name=cite-umit2017&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Umit, 2017](#bib-umit2017))


--
name: potential-biases

- mediation

  - the behaviour on Twitter is mediated through written and unwritten rules
     - e.g., there is a button to like, but no dislike
         - might systematically bias the replies towards negative   
&lt;br&gt;
     - e.g., the common use of the like function as a bookmark
         - what would a study of Twitter likes be measuring?

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Constraints over Data Access

- Twitter has restrictions on data access

  - how much data is available to download
  - how quickly, how frequently, how far dating back *etc*.
     
--
&lt;br&gt;

- These restrictions vary across API types

  - e.g., [Standard v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1) is the most restrictive APIs
      - other first generation APIs are the [Premium v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/premium-apis) and [Enterprise: Gnip 2.0](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/enterprise) APIs &amp;mdash; both with paid subscriptions
      - there are also the second generation APIs, including the newly announced [Academic Research access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research)

--
&lt;br&gt;

- These restrictions also vary within APIs types, across different operations

  - e.g., collecting tweets in real time *vs*. collecting historical tweets
     - but also, collecting historical tweets from a specific user *vs*. tweets from any user

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Constraints over Data Redistribution

- Twitter restricts content redistribution

   - e.g., only the tweet and/or user IDs can be made publicly available in datasets over 50,000 observations
      - e.g., not the tweets themselves
      - and no more than 1.5M IDs
         - with some exceptions for academic research   
&lt;br&gt;
   - see [Twitter Developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy) for further details   

--
&lt;br&gt;

- Reproducibility of research based on Twitter data is limited in practice

  - i.e., reproducibility after publication, by others
  - technically, they can retrieve the same tweets with IDs
      - demanding for reproducers
      - may even be impossible
          - e.g., some tweets, or whole accounts, might be deleted before replication attempts

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Changes in the Twitter APIs

- Twitter is currently switching to a new generation of APIs

  - replacing APIs v1 with v2
      - each with various types of APIs   
&lt;br&gt;
  - the switch is not complete, outcome is not clear
     - see the [early access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access) options
     
--
&lt;br&gt;

- Twitter might change the rules of the APIs game at any anytime, again

  - making the existing restrictions more or less strict
     - e.g., while you are in the middle of data collection     
&lt;br&gt;
  - breaking your plans, code

  
---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Changes in the Twitter APIs &amp;mdash; Notes

- Existing codes to collect tweets may or may not be affected, depending on

   - how the APIs v2 will look in the end
       - it is still a work in progress   
&lt;br&gt;
   - how the `rtweet` package&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; will adopt
       - it is currently going through a major revision


.footnote[

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; This is the R package that we will use to collect tweets. More details are in [Part 2](#part2). 

]   

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Changes in the Twitter APIs &amp;mdash; Notes

- Existing codes to collect tweets may or may not be affected, depending on

   - how the APIs V2 will look in the end
       - it is still a work in progress   
&lt;br&gt;
   - whether and how the `rtweet` package will adopt
       - it is currently going through a major revision

&lt;br&gt;

- Not all changes are bad

   - among others, APIs v2 introduces the [Academic Research access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research)    
&lt;br&gt;
       - 'to serve the unique needs and challenges of academic researchers'
           - ranging from master's students to professors    
&lt;br&gt;
       - access to all public tweets
          - by up to 1.5M a month at a time
       
---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Law and Ethics

- It is often impossible to get users' consent

  - i.e., for collecting and analysing their data on Twitter    
&lt;br&gt;
  - Twitter itself has no problem with it, but others might disagree
      - e.g., your law makers, (funding and/or research) institution, subjects, conscience
    
--

&lt;br&gt;

- Check the rules that apply to your case
   
  - rules and regulations in your country, at your institution
  
--

&lt;br&gt;

- Reflect on whether using Twitter data for research is ethical

  - even where it is legal and allowed, it may not be moral

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Data Storage

Twitter data frequently requires 

- large amounts of digital storage space

  - Twitter data is typically big data
      - many tweets, up to 90 variables   
&lt;br&gt;
  - e.g., a dataset of 1M tweets requires about 300MB 
      - when stored in R data formats

--

- private, safe storage spaces

  - due to [Twitter Developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)
  - but also local rules, institutional requirements

---
## Considerations &amp;mdash; Language and Context

- Some tools of text analysis are developed for a specific language and/or context

   - e.g., dictionaries for sentiment analysis
       - might be in English, for political texts, only
       
   - these may not be useful, valid for different languages, and/or contexts
   
--

&lt;br&gt;

- Some tools of text analysis are developed for general use

   - e.g., a dictionary for sentiments in everyday language
   
   - these may not be useful, valid for a specific context
      - e.g., political texts

## Workshop Slides &amp;mdash; Access on Your Browser

- Having the workshop slides&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; on your own machine might be helpful

  - flexibility to go back and forward on your own
  - ability to scroll across long codes on some slides

&lt;br&gt;

- Access at &lt;https://resulumit.com/teaching/twtr_workshop.html&gt;

## RStudio Project &amp;mdash; Create from within RStudio 

- RStudio allows for dividing your work with R into separate projects

  - each project gets dedicated workspace, history, and source documents
  - [this page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) has more information on why projects are recommended

&lt;br&gt;

- Create a new RStudio project for the existing&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; workshop directory `...\twtr_workshop-materials` from the RStudio menu:

&gt; `File -&gt; New Project -&gt; Existing Directory -&gt; Browse -&gt; ...\twtr_workshop-materials -&gt; Open`

## Twitter &amp;mdash; Authorisation

Authorization to use Twitter APIs requires at least three steps&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;

1) open a user account on Twitter
  - a personal or an institutional (perhaps, for a research project) one
  - done once, takes minutes
      
2) with that user account, apply for a developer account
  - so that you are recognised as a developer, have access to the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal)
  - done once per account, .yellow-h[takes days to get approved manually]
      
3) with that developer account, register a Twitter app
  - so that you have the keys and tokens for authorisation
  - repeated for every project, takes minutes
      
      
.footnote[

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; There may be additional steps, such as registering for the [Academic Research product track](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/academic/is-it-right-for-you).

]

---
## Twitter &amp;mdash; Authorisation &amp;mdash; Notes

- It is possible to interact with Twitter APIs without steps 2 and 3

  - `rtweet` has a its own Twitter app &amp;mdash; `rstats2twitter` &amp;mdash; that anyone can use
      - anyone with a Twitter account, who authorises `rstats2twitter` via a pop-up browser

--

&lt;br&gt;

- I recommend
   
   - following only the step 1 (open an account) now, which
       - you might already have done
       - is otherwise automatic
       - allows us to use `rstats2twitter` and follow the workshop   
&lt;br&gt;
   - leaving the remaining steps until [Part 8](#part-8)
       - to allow you to think and write your applications carefully
       - to get my feedback if you prefer to do so
       
---
class: action

## Twitter &amp;mdash; Open an Account

Sign up for Twitter at [https://twitter.com/](twitter.com)

- a pre-condition for interacting with Twitter APIs

    - e.g., you must be authorized 
       - even to use `rtweet`'s app &amp;mdash; `rstats2twitter`
    
&lt;br&gt;
- helpful for getting to know what you study

    - e.g., the written and unwritten rules that mediate the behaviour on Twitter
        - as discussed [in Part 1](#potential-biases)

&lt;br&gt;
- with a strategic username

  - usernames are changeable, but nevertheless public
      - either choose an anonymous username (e.g., `asdf029348`)
      - or choose one carefully &amp;mdash; they become a part of users' online presence

# Part 3. Data Collection

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]
---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Overview &amp;mdash; APIs
  
- We will collect data through APIs    

  - i.e., Twitter's [Standard v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1) APIs
  - provides more variables than available through browsers
  - comes with rules and restrictions
      - enforced through authentication

--
&lt;br&gt;

- Collecting data through web scraping is also possible    

   - e.g., with `GetOldTweets3` &amp;mdash; [a python library](https://pypi.org/project/GetOldTweets3/)
      - scrapes, scrolls down, and scrapes again to collect all matching data   
&lt;br&gt;
   - does not require, is not limited by, Twitter APIs
   - limited with what is available on browsers
   - may or may not be ethical and/or legal

---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Overview &amp;mdash; APIs &amp;mdash; Types

- .yellow-h[In general], there are two main types of APIs   

   - REST and Streaming
   - applies to APIS elsewhere, not just at Twitter
   - functions, arguments, behaviour differ slightly
   
--

&lt;br&gt;

- REST APIs are for single, one-off requests    

   - e.g., search for tweets posted in the last 6 to 9 days
   - but also, post or delete tweets
   
--

&lt;br&gt;

- Streaming APIs are for continuous requests    

   - e.g., collect tweets as they are being posted

---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Overview &amp;mdash; APIs &amp;mdash; Types

- .yellow-h[At Twitter], there is a further differentiation among the APIs   

   - e.i., [API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access), [Enterprise: Gnip 2.0](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise), [Premium v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium), [Standard v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1)
   - with each, you can make single or continuous requests

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Rules and restrictions differ from one type to another   

  - as does the cost
  - some remove the restrictions on how much data we can access
  - restrictions on how .yellow[quickly] we can access data exist in all types
     - these restrictions are called [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/rate-limits)
     
--

&lt;br&gt;

- Rules and restrictions can also differ within one type
 
  - for different operations  
      - e.g., for collecting historical *vs*. live data


---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Overview &amp;mdash; Standard v1.1 APIs

- We will collect data through Twitter's Standard v1.1 APIs  

  - free of charge
  - thanks to `rweet`'s `rstats2twitter` app, can be used immediately
  - comes with the strictest of restrictions
        - e.g., searches tweets posted in the last 6 to 9 days

--
&lt;br&gt;

- You can surpass these restrictions later on    

   - academic researchers can apply for [Academic Research access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research)
   - others can purchase an alternative
   - the principles of data collection are likely to remain the same
       - `rweet` has the `search_30day` and `search_fullarchive` functions for the [Premium V1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/premium-apis) APIs
       - the package may require an update, in line with the [Academic Research access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research)
       
---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Overview &amp;mdash; APIs &amp;mdash; Limitations

Our attempts to collect data will be limited for various reasons, including

- the intended restrictions by Twitter
   - by the limitations of Standard v1.1
      - e.g., by rate limits
         - maximum number of requests 
         - per app, type of request, time interval

--

- any lack of tweets or users matching our search criteria
    - stricter the criteria, more likely to occur

--

- connections timing out
    - depends on type of requests, and your internet connection
    - more likely for continuous searches

--

- reasons unknown to humankind
   - sometimes things just happen

---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; `rtweet` &amp;mdash; Overview

- A powerful R package for collecting Twitter data

  - created by [Michael W. Kearney](https://mikewk.com/) (University of Missouri)
  - used widely, replacing previous packages for this task
      - e.g., `twitteR`
  - last updated on CRAN two years ago
      - the package is currently being updated on GitHub

--

- A lot has already been written on this package. See, for example, 

    - the [package repository](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) on GitHub
    - the [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf)
    - this [journal article](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01829) by its creator
    - this [book](https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/) by Bob Rudis &amp;mdash; a user of the package
    - numerous tutorials, such as [this](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/collecting-and-analyzing-twitter-using-r/), [this](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/rtweet), and [this](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/get-data-using-apis/use-twitter-api-r/)

--

- Comes with its own app, `rstats2twitter`
    - allows for collecting tweets without a developer account
    - offers the option of using your own keys and tokens, if/once you have them

---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; `rtweet` &amp;mdash; Basics

There are four main groups of functions to collect .yellow-h[historical] data, starting with

- **`search_`**
    - such as `search_tweets` or `search_users`
    - 4 functions, for general use
          - 2 for standard APIs, 2 for premium APIs

--
      
- **`lookup_`**
    - such as `lookup_tweets` or `lookup_users`
    - 5 functions, for expanding an existing variable into a dataset
          - e.g., starting with a list of IDs for tweets or users

--
      
- **`get_`**
    - such as `get_followers` or `get_friends`
    - 11 functions, for specific tasks

--
      
- **`lists_`**
    - such as `lists_members` or `lists_statuses`
    - 6 functions, for tasks related to [Twitter lists](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists#:~:text=A%20List%20is%20a%20curated,the%20accounts%20on%20that%20List.) specifically


---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; `rtweet` &amp;mdash; Basics

There is also .yellow-h[one] function to collect tweets in .yellow-h[real time]

- **`stream_tweets`**

  - queries the streaming API
  - returns a small random sample of all tweets as they are posted
  - can be filtered by keywords, users, and/or locations

--

&lt;br&gt;

- For other functions, see the [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf)

  - e.g., the functions starting with `post_`
      - allowing for posting your tweets, direct messages, from within R

## Exercises

1) Collect the top 300 tweets that 
- include the hashtag "AcademicTwitter"
- and assign the resulting data frame to `df_tweets`
   - so that you can observe the results with ease
   - hence, I recommend doing the same for all APIs searches that follow

2) Observe how the `rstats2twitter` app works
  - when you call the function, pay attention to what happens on your R console and on your default browser
     - this will happen only once per R session
  
3) Take some time to explore the data frame
- see which variables are in there, and how they are called
- think about how you could use these variables for research
- hint: use functions like `View`, `str`, `names`, `tibble::glimpse`


4) Conduct the same search on a browser
- using the [advanced search form](https://twitter.com/search-advanced)
- compare and contrast the API- and browser-based searches

    
<div class="countdown" id="timer_6223c562" style="top:0;right:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">15</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Notes

- Twitter usernames, or handles, are stored under variable `screen_name`

   - can be misleading, as users also have display names

--

- Twitter allows user to change their usernames and display names

   - user IDs, however, do not change
      - `user_id` is a better variable for reproducible research

--

- The date and time data are matched to Greenwhich Mean Time

   - stored under the variable `created_at`
   - no matter where users actually are at the time of tweeting

--

- You may wish to exclude retweets

   - depending on the research question and design
   - by setting `include_rts = FALSE`

## Data Collection &amp;mdash; `search_tweets` &amp;mdash; Notes

- This function returns a data frame

  - as do many other functions in the package
  - because, by default, `parse = TRUE`

&lt;br&gt;

- Under the hood, Twitter APIs return nested lists

  - nested lists can be tidied into rectangular shape, but not tidy data as they are returned
  - `rtweet` does most of the data preparation for us

## Exercises

5) Collect the latest 200 tweets that include
- the phrase "publish or perish"
- and the word "academia" but not the word "phd"

&lt;br&gt;

6) Collect the most recent 200 tweets that
- include the word "Luzern"
- sent within 25 mile radius around Lucerne city centre
- excluding retweets
- hint: pull the help file for the function to see which arguments you can use
   - get help from Google about the coordinates

&lt;br&gt;

7) Collect the most recent 35,000 tweets that
- include the word "phd"
- note that this is over the limit of 18,000
- hint: pull the help file for the function to see which argument you must use to surpass the limit

   - so that you can observe the resulting data frame better

&lt;br&gt; 

13) Check your remaining limits for the `search_tweets` function
   - assign it to a name so that you can remember

&lt;br&gt;

14) Collect the top 5000 tweets that 
- include the word "PhD"
- and posted by a verified account

&lt;br&gt;

15) Check your remaining limits for the `search_tweets` function again
- how do they compare to the results from exercise 13?

# Part 4. Data Preperation

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Overview

- The `rtweet` package does a very good job with data preperation to start with

   - returns data frames, with mostly tidy data
   - although Twitter APIs return nested lists
   - some variables are still lists
      - e.g., `hastags`

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Further data preparation depends on your research project

   - most importantly, on whether you will work with texts or not
   - we will cover some common preparation steps

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Overview &amp;mdash; Strings

- Most researchers would be interested in textual Twitter data

   - tweets as a whole, but also specifically hashtags *etc*.

--

&lt;br&gt;

- There are many components of tweets as texts

   - e.g., mentions, hashtags, emojis, links *etc*.
   - but also punctuation, white spaces, upper case letters *etc*.
   - some of these may need to be taken out before analysis

--

&lt;br&gt;

- I use the `stringr` package &lt;a name=cite-R-stringr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Wickham, 2019](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stringr)) for string operations

   - part of the `tidyverse` family
   - you might have another favourite already
       - no need to change as long as it does the job
       
---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Overview &amp;mdash; Numbers

- There is more to Twitter data than just tweets
      
  - e.g., the number of followers, likes *etc*.
     - see Silva and Proksch &lt;a name=cite-silva2021&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Silva and Proksch, 2021](#bib-silva2021)) for a great example

--
&lt;br&gt;

- I use the `dplyr` package &lt;a name=cite-R-dplyr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Wickham, FranÃ§ois, Henry, and MÃ¼ller, 2021](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)) for most data operations

   - part of the `tidyverse` family
   - you might have another favourite already
       - no need to change as long as it does the job

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Mentions


```r
tweet &lt;- "These from @handle1 are #socool. 👏 A #mustsee, @handle2! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1
          👉 https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"
```


```r
str_remove_all(string = tweet, pattern = "[@][\\w_-]+")
```


.out-t[

[1] "This from  are #socool. 👏 A #mustsee, ! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1
          👉 https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"

]


---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Hashtags



```r
tweet &lt;- "These from @handle1 are #socool. 👏 A #mustsee, @handle2! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1
          👉 https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"
```


```r
str_remove_all(string = tweet, pattern = "[`#`][\\w_-]+")
```


.out-t[

[1] "These from @handle1 are . 👏 A , @handle2! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1
          👉 https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"

]

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Links


```r
tweet &lt;- "These from @handle1 are #socool. 👏 A #mustsee, @handle2! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1
          👉 https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"
```


```r
str_remove_all(string = tweet, pattern = "http\\S+\\s*")
```


.out-t[

[1] "These from @handle1 are. 👏 A, @handle2! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1"

]

&lt;br&gt;

- Notice that

  - links come in various formats
  - you may need multiple or complicated regular expression patterns

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Links &amp;mdash; Alternative

Use the `urls_t.co` variable to remove all links

- if there are more than one link in a tweet, they are stored as a list in this variable



```r
# start with your existing dataset of tweets
df_tweets &lt;- df_tweets %&gt;%
  
# limit the operation to within individual tweets  
  group_by(status_id) %&gt;%
  
# create a new variable of tweets without links  
  mutate(tidy_text = 
           
# by removing them from the existing variable `text`           
           str_remove_all(string = text, 
 
# that matches the `urls_t.co` variable, after being collapsed into a string      
           pattern = str_c(unlist(urls_t.co), collapse = "|")))
```

class: action

<div class="countdown" id="timer_6223c583" style="top:0;right:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">08</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Emojis


```r
tweet &lt;- "These from @handle1 are #socool. 👏 A #mustsee, @handle2! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1
          👉 https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"
```


```r
iconv(x = tweet, from = "latin1", to = "ASCII", sub = "")
```


.out-t[

[1] "These from @handle1 are #socool. A #mustsee, @handle2! 
          t.co/aq7MJJ1
          https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"

]


---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Exercises &amp;mdash; Notes


- The exercises in this part are best followed by

  - using `tweets.rds` or similar dataset
  - saving a new variable at every step of preparation
  - observing the newly created variables 
      - to confirm whether the code works as intended

&lt;br&gt;

- The `mutate` function, from the `dplyr` package, can be helpful, as follows

   - recall that `text` is the variable for tweets


```r
tweets &lt;- read_rds("data/tweets.rds")

clean_tweets &lt;- tweets %&gt;%
  `mutate(no_mentions` = str_remove_all(string = `text`, pattern = "[@][\\w_-]+"))
```

---
class: action

## Exercises


41) Remove mentions

- hint: the pattern is `"[@][\\w_-]+"`

42) Remove hastags
- hint: the pattern is `"[#][\\w_-]+"`

43) Remove links
- by using the links from the `urls_t.co` variable

44) Remove emojis
- pull the help file for the `iconv` function first


<div class="countdown" id="timer_6223c430" style="top:0;right:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">10</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>


---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Punctuations


```r
tweet &lt;- "These from @handle1 are #socool. 👏 A #mustsee, @handle2! 
          👉 t.co/aq7MJJ1
          👉 https://t.co/aq7MJJ2"
```


```r
str_remove_all(string = tweet, pattern = "[[:punct:]]")
```


.out-t[

[1] "This from are socool 👏 A mustsee handle2
          👉 tcoaq7MJJ1
          👉 httpst.coaq7MJJ2"

]

Notice that
   - this removed all punctuation, including those in mentions, hashtags, and links
   - if tweets are typed with no spaces after punctuation, this might lead to merged pieces of text
      - alternatively, try the `str_replace` function to replace punctuation with space
      
---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Punctuations &amp;mdash; Alternative


```r
tweet &lt;- "This is a sentence.There is no space before this sentence."
```


```r
str_`remove`_all(string = tweet, pattern = "[[:punct:]]")
```

.out-t[

[1] "This is a sentenceThere is no space before this sentence"

]

--

&lt;br&gt;



```r
str_`replace`_all(string = tweet, pattern = "[[:punct:]]", replacement = " ")
```

.out-t[

[1] "This is a sentence There is no space before this sentence "

]

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Punctuations &amp;mdash; Alternative



```r
tweet &lt;- "This is a sentence.There is no space before this sentence."
```


```r
str_replace_all(string = tweet, pattern = "[[:punct:]]", replacement = " ")
```

.out-t[

[1] "This is a sentence There is no space before this sentence "

]

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Repeated Whitespace



```r
tweet &lt;- "There are too many spaces after this sentence.   This is a new sentence."
```


```r
str_squish(string = tweet)
```

.out-t[

[1] "There are too many spaces after this sentence. This is a new sentence."

]

Note that
- white spaces can be introduced not only by users on Twitter, but also by us, while cleaning the data
   - e.g., removing and/or replacing operations above
   - hence, this function might be useful after other operations

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Case


```r
tweet &lt;- "lower case. Sentence case. Title Case. UPPER CASE."
```


```r
str_to_lower(string = tweet)
```

.out-t[

[1] "lower case. sentence case. title case. upper case."

]

Note that
   - there are other functions in this family, including
      - `str_to_sentence`, `str_to_title`, `str_to_upper`


---
class: action

## Exercises

45) Remove punctuations
- by using the `str_replace_all` function
- hint: the pattern is `[[:punct:]]`

&lt;br&gt;

46) Remove whitespace
- hint: the function is called `str_squish`

&lt;br&gt;

47) Change case to lower case
- hint: the function is called `str_to_lower`

## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Unit of Observation

Research designs might require changing the unit of observation
   - aggregation
      - e.g., at the level of users, locations, hashtags etc.
      - summarise with `dplyr`
   

  - dis-aggregation
     - e.g., to the level of words
     - tokenise with `tidytext`
     
---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Unit of Observation &amp;mdash; Aggregation

Aggregate at the level of users

- the number of tweets per user


```r
# load the tweets dataset
df &lt;- read_rds("tweets.rds") %&gt;%
  
# group by users for aggregation  
  group_by(user_id) %&gt;%
  
# create summary statistics for variables of interest
  summarise(sum_tweets = n())
```

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Unit of Observation &amp;mdash; Aggregation

What is aggregated at which level depends on your research design, such as
   - aggregate the tweets into a single text
   - at the level of users by source



```r
# load the tweets dataset
df &lt;- read_rds("tweets.rds") %&gt;%
  
# group by users for aggregation  
  group_by(user_id, `source`) %&gt;%
  
# create summary statistics for variables of interest
  summarise(`merged_tweets = paste0(text, collapse = ". ")`) 
```

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Unit of Observation &amp;mdash; Dis-aggregation

Disaggregate the tweets, by splitting them into smaller units
  - also called .yellow-h[tokenisation]

Note that
- by default `sep = "[^[:alnum:].]+"`, which works well with separating tweets into words
   - change this argument with a regular expression of your choice
- this creates a tidy dataset, where each observation is a word
   - all other tweet-level variables are repeated for each observation


```r
# load the tweets dataset
df &lt;- read_rds("tweets.rds") %&gt;%
  
# split the variable `text`  
    separate_rows(text)
```

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Unit of Observation &amp;mdash; Dis-aggregation

The `tidytext` has a function that works better with tokenising tweets
- with `token = "tweets"`, it dis-aggregates text into words
   - except that it respects usernames, hashtags, and URLS 


```r
# load the tweets dataset
df &lt;- read_rds("tweets.rds") %&gt;%
  
# split the variable `text`, create a new variable called `da_tweets`    
    unnest_tokens(output = da_tweets, input = text, token = "tweets")
```

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Unit of Observation &amp;mdash; Dis-aggregation

Tokenise variables to levels other than words
- e.g., characters, words (the default),  sentences, lines


```r
# load the tweets dataset
df &lt;- read_rds("tweets.rds") %&gt;%
  
# split the variable `text` into sentences, create a new variable called `da_tweets`    
    unnest_tokens(output = da_tweets, input = text, `token = "sentences"`)
```

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Change Unit of Observation &amp;mdash; Dis-aggregation

Tokenise variables other than tweets
- recall that `rtweet` stores multiple hastags, mentions *etc*. as lists



```r
# load the tweets dataset
df &lt;- read_rds("tweets.rds") %&gt;%
  
# unlist the lists of hashtags to create strings  
  group_by(status_id) %&gt;%
  mutate(tidy_hashtags = str_c(unlist(hashtags), collapse = " ")) %&gt;%
  
# split the string, create a new variable called `da_tweets`    
  unnest_tokens(output = da_hashtags, input = tidy_hashtags, token = "words")
```

---
## Data Preperation &amp;mdash; Remove Stop Words

Remove the common, uninformative words
- e.g., the, a, i

Note that 
- this operation requires a tokenised-to-word variable
- stop words for English are stored in the `stop_words` dataset in the `tidytext` variable
- list of words for other languages are available elsewhere, including 
   - the `stopwordslangs` function from the `rtweet` package
   - the `stopwords` function from the `tm` package
      - e.g., use `tm::stopwords("german")` for German


```r
# load the tweets dataset
df &lt;- read_rds("tweets.rds") %&gt;%
  
# split the variable `text`, create a new variable called `da_tweets`    
  unnest_tokens(output = da_tweets, input = text, token = "tweets") %&gt;%
 
# remove rows that match any of the stop words as stored in the stop_words dataset 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("da_tweets" = "word"))
```

## Exercises

48) Aggregate `text` to a higher level
- e.g., if you are not using `tweets.rds`, to MP level
   - if not, perhaps to `source` level

&lt;br&gt;

49) Dis-aggregate `text` to a lower level
- e.g., to words

&lt;br&gt;

50) Dis-aggregate `hashtags`
- i.e., make sure each row has at most one hashtag

&lt;br&gt;

51) Remove stop words

## Analysing Users &amp;mdash; Overview

- Twitter analysis might focus on users

  - e.g., members of parliaments
  - as opposed to their tweets on Twitter
      - not always mutually exclusive
  - might be supplemented with non-Twitter data
      - e.g., `data/mps.csv`

--

&lt;br&gt;

- There are at least two types of user-based analysis

   - count things, and describe or correlate
      - e.g., who has the most followers
         - are female MPs more or less likely to have large number of followers?
    - network analysis
      - e.g., who retweets whom, how often?

# Network Analysis

---
## Analysing Users &amp;mdash; Network Analysis &amp;mdash; Overview

- Twitter data is suitable for network analysis

  - a social network
  - studying the relations between users

&lt;br&gt;

- There are at least five networks

   - networks of followers
       - directed, not reoccurring 
       - e.g., who is following whom     
&lt;br&gt;
   - networks of retweeters, quoters, repliers, and likers
       - directed, reoccurring
       - e.g., who is replying to whom, how often

---
## Analysing Users &amp;mdash; Network Analysis &amp;mdash; Basics

- Networks are composed of nodes and edges
   
   - e.g., who (a node) replies (an edge) to whom (another node), how often (the strength of the edge)
   
--

&lt;br&gt;

- The nodes and edges are often kept separate for analysis
    
  - e.g., in separate datasets, frames
  - nodes are given an ID number
  
--

&lt;br&gt;

- We will use two pacakges for network analysis
   
   - `tidygraph` for data manipulation
   - `ggraph` for visualisation

# Dictionary Methods

---
## Analysing Users &amp;mdash; Dictionary Methods &amp;mdash; Overview

- Dictionary methods are based on pre-categorisation of words

  - e.g., the word happy might be categorised as positive
      - sad would be negative
      
  - e.g., the word happy might be categorised as 0.2 sophisticated
      - contented might be 0.4 sophisticated

--

&lt;br&gt;

- These catagories are than matched with the text we have
   
  - to calculate scores for, e.g., each tweet

---
## Analysing Users &amp;mdash; Dictionary Methods &amp;mdash; Notes

- There are many ways to calculate scores

   - depending on your research design

&lt;br&gt;

- Positive score could be

   - `sum(positive)`
   - `sum(positive) - sum(negative)`
   - `(sum(positive) - sum(negative)) / (sum(positive) + sum(negative))`
   
- We will use 
   
  - the sentiment dictionary stored at `tidytext::get_sentiments("nrc")`
  - the concreteness dictionary stored at `doc2concrete::mturk_list`

- On [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/), click `Apply`
   - at the top-right corner of the page&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
   - follow the instructions on consecutive pages    

&lt;br&gt;

- Write a detailed case for your intended use of Twitter APIs
       - not just that you are attending this workshop
       - a quick application is likely to slow the review process
          - as Twitter often asks for more details via email
       - rejection is also a possibility    

&lt;br&gt;

- Carefully review the Twitter's [Developer Agreement and Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)
       - especially important if you will develop an app that
           - others will use

   - follow the instructions on consecutive pages
       - you will need a unique name for your app
       
  - note that, once the app is registered, you are provided with keys and tokens
      - you will use these for authentication
          - if you choose not to authenticate through `rtweet`'s own app, called `rstats2twitter`
          - more on this in [Part 3](#part3)
          
- does not mean you have to create an actual app
    - e.g., an app for smart phones

---
## Twitter &amp;mdash; Keys and Tokens &amp;mdash; Notes          
      
- Keys and tokens are personal
   - should not be shared with others
      - e.g., through replication files, when asking a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 

--
          
- Keys and tokens can be re-generated anytime
  - on your applications page, under the `Keys and tokens` tab
  - this requires updating your R script with the new tokens as well
  
--

- Twitter allows for further, optional settings involving keys and tokens
   - relevant, mostly, for apps to do more than just collecting tweets
   - e.g., settings for 3-legged OAuth
      - like `rstats2twitter`, to allow for other users to authenticate through a browser pop up
   - not covered in this workshop
   
---
## Twitter &amp;mdash; Keys and Tokens &amp;mdash; Notes &amp;mdash; Definitions

- Consumer key and Consumer secret

  - identifiers for an application
  - provide .yellow-h[project authorization]
     - identify the application
     - check whether the application has been granted access
  - like your application's username and password

--

- Access token and Access token secret

  - identifier for users of an application
     - this may or may not include anyone other than the owner
     - e.g., for `rstats2twitter`, there are many users
  - provide .yellow-h[user authentication] 
     - identify the user
     - check whether the user should have access to a request

## Data Collection &amp;mdash; `rtweet` &amp;mdash; Authentication

There are two different methods of [authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/overview)   
&lt;br&gt;   
- through `rtweet`'s `rstats2twitter` app
      
  - the app makes requests on your behalf
  - you simply approve this, via a browser that pops up
  - nice and easy, but comes with some limitations  
  
--

&lt;br&gt;  
      
- through your own app   
      
  - you make requests on your behalf
  - through your own app that you register as a developer 
  - takes a little effort, but comes with additional stability and functionality
        - removing the dependency on `rstats2twitter`, over which you have no control
        - getting rid of the pop up windows   
        - not only for collecting tweets, but also posting your own tweets
              - and, reading and writing your own direct messages

name: create-token
class: action

## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Define Your Token

If you are using your own app to authenticate, create a token
- using the `create_token` function
- the `app` argument requires for the name of your own app, as registered on [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/)
- the other arguments to be filled with the information from the `Keys and tokens` tab on the same website



```r
tw_token &lt;- create_token(
    app = "",
    consumer_key = "",
    consumer_secret = "",
    access_token = "",
    access_secret = ""
  )
```

---
## Data Collection &amp;mdash; Define Your Token &amp;mdash; Alternatives

.pull-left[
- You may wish to put your keys and tokens elsewhere
   - they are personal, just like a password

- There are at least two alternatives
   - .yellow-h[create a separate script, which you can then `source` at the top of your main script]
   
]
   
.pull-right[

`keys_tokens.R`


```r
 tw_token &lt;- create_token(
    app = "",
    consumer_key = "",
    consumer_secret = "",
    access_token = "",
    access_secret = ""
   )
```


`data_collection.R`


```r
 library(rtweet)
 `source("keys_tokens.R")`
```
