## The Workshop &mdash; Overview

- Two days, on how to collect, process, and analyse data from Twitter

  - 200+ slides, 40+ exercises, and time for working on a real project

--

- Based on converting a mock manuscript written in Word to R Markdown

  - plus, improving its reproducibility and version-controlling it
  - with a PDF output in mind

--

- Designed for researchers with basic knowledge of R programming language

  - does not cover programming with R
      - e.g., writing functions    
<br>
  - existing ability to work with data in R will be very helpful
      - but not absolutely necessary &mdash; this ability can be developed during and after the workshop as well
        
---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation

- Twitter provides attractive opportunities for academic research
    - a simple search for "twitter data" returns 55,000+ results on Google Scholar, by the end of 2020

--

- Research based on Twitter data requires a set of skills 
    - typically, these skills are not part of academic training


---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Opportunities

- Popularity of the network
  - about 350 million users, more than half are daily active
  - your subjects are likely Twitter users
    - e.g., for me, members of parliament

--

- Richness of the data
  - about 500 million tweets per day<sup>*</sup>
  - with up to 90 variables for each tweet

--

- Accesibilty of the data
  - most Twitter data are public
    - i.e., relatively few private profiles
  - programmatic access to Twitter is enabled
    - through API (application programming interface)

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> The user and usage statistics on this slide are compiled by [BusinessOfApps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitter-statistics).

]

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Challenges

- Research based on Twitter data requires certain skills
    - e.g., availability of API is meaningless for researchers who cannot write code yet
    - processing and analysing are no less challenging without programming skills

- The required skills are often uncovered in the academic training of social scientists
    - e.g., methodology courses
    - but help is available elsewhere
      - collaborate with researchers with the skillset
         - sacrificing some control over your research and research agenda
      - acquire the skills through individual effort
        - e.g., workshops such as this one

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Aims

- To provide you with an understanding of what is possible with R

  - we will cover a large breath of issues, not all of it is for long-term memory
      - one reason why the slides are designed for self study as well    
<br>
  - awareness of what is possible, `Google`, and perseverance are all we need

--

- To start you with acquiring and practicing the skills needed 

  - practice with ready-written code
  - start working on a real project

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

Slides with this background colour indicate that your action is required, for

- setting the workshop up
    - e.g., installing R 
    
- completing the exercises
    - e.g., downloading tweets
    - there are 40+ exercises
    - these slides have countdown timers
        - as a guide, not to be followed strictly
    
`r countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

- Codes and texts that go in R console or scripts .inline-c[appear as such &mdash; in a different font, on gray background]
    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

```{r, demonstration, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = h5_median, y = h5_index, color = subfield)) +
       geom_point() +
       facet_wrap(. ~ branch) +
       scale_colour_discrete(name = "Journal Type", breaks = c(0, 1), labels = c("Generalist", "Subfield"))    

```

---

    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

- Results that come out in output files .out-t[appear as such &mdash; in the same font, on green background]
    - except very obvious results, such as figures and tables
    
--
    
- Specific sections are .yellow-h[highlighted yellow as such] for emphasis
    - these could be for anything &mdash; codes and texts in input, results in output, and/or texts on slides
    
--

- The slides are designed for self-study as much as for the workshop
    - *accessible*, in substance and form, to go through on your own

# Part 1. Before You Start

.footnote[

---
## Considerations &mdash; Reseach Questions & Hypotheses

- Ideally, we already have one or more research questions, hypotheses
  - developed prior to data collection on Twitter and analysis
    - based on, e.g., theory, claims, observations

--

- Not all questions can be answered with Twitter data
  - see relevant literature for what works, what does not
    - e.g., for political science, the review by [Jungherr (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19331681.2015.1132401)
    - for public health, the review by [Sinnenberg et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303512)

---
## Considerations &mdash; Potential Biases

There are two sources of potential bias in Twitter data

- sampling
  - Twitter users are not representative of the people out there
     - see, for example, [Mellon and Prosser (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2053168017720008)
  - what users (do not) tweet about has a strategic component [Umit (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/13572334.2017.1283166)


- 
mediation
  - the behaviour on Twitter is mediated through written and unwritten rules
    - e.g., the function to like, but no dislike
      - does this systematically bias the replies towards negative?
    - e.g., the common use of the like function as a bookmark
      - what would a study of likes measure?

---
## Considerations &mdash; Constraints over Data Access

- Twitter has restrictions on data access
    - how much data can you download through API
        - how quickly, frequently, how far dating back, *etc*
        
--

- These restrictions vary from one operation to another, a lot!
    - e.g., historical tweets from all users, including a word
        - up to 18,000 tweets
        - posted up to seven to nine days prior to search
    
    - e.g., historical tweets from a given user
        - up to 3,200 most recent tweets
        - posted anytime
        
    - e.g., live tweets, including a word
        - up to 1% of the total volume
    
.footnote[

We will discuss these limitations in more detail in [Part 2](#part2). 

]

---
## Considerations &mdash; Constraints over Data Access

- Twitter has restrictions on data access
    - how much data can you download through API
        - how quickly, frequently, how far dating back, *etc*

- These restrictions vary from one operation to another, a lot!
    - e.g., historical tweets from all users vs. from a given user

- Twitter might change the rules of the game anytime
    - making these restrictions more or less stricter

---
## Considerations &mdash; Constraints over Data Redistribution

- Twitter restricts content redistribution
   - only Tweet IDs can be made publicly available in datasets
      - not tweets themselves
 - see [Twitter Developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy) for further details
 
- Reproducibility of research based on Twitter data is limited in practice
    - i.e., reproducibility after publication, by others
    - technically, they can retrieve the tweets with IDs
        - in practice, this is very demanding, and may even be impossible
            - e.g., the tweets, accounts might be deleted

---
## Considerations &mdash; Changes in the Twitter API

- Twitter is currently switching to a new API
    - replacing API v1 with API v2
    - see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access

--

- Existing codes to collect tweets may or may not be affected, depending on
   - how the API v2 will look in the end
       - it is still a work in progress
   - whether and how the `rtweet` package<sup>*<sup> will adopt

--

- Not all changes are bad
   - among others, API v2 promises
       - 'to serve the unique needs and challenges of academic researchers'
           - see https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research
       - unlimited access to all public tweets
   
.footnote[

<sup>*<sup> This is the R package that we will use to collect tweets. More details are in [Part 2](#part2). 

]

---
## Considerations &mdash; Law and Ethics

- It may be illegal and/or unethical to collect and analyze twitter data without user consent
    - Twitter has no problem with it, but
    - your country and/or (funding) institution may think otherwise
    
--
    
- Check the rules that apply to your case

- Reflect on whether using Twitter data for research is ethical

---
## Considerations &mdash; Data Storage

Twitter data might require 

- large amounts of digital storage space
    - typically big data
       - many tweets, variables
    - e.g., a dataset of 1M tweets requires about 250MB 
        - when stored in .Rdata format

--

- private, safe storage spaces
    - due to Twitter's terms
    - but also local laws, institutional requirements
    
---
## Considerations &mdash; Language and Context

- Some tools of analysis are developed for a specific language and context
   - e.g., dictionaries for sentiment analysis, 
       - e.g., in English, for political texts
   - these may not be useful, valid for different languages, and context
   
--

- Some tools of analysis are developed for general context
   - e.g., a dictionary for sentiment analysis in general
   - these may not be useful, valid for a specific context
      - e.g., political science
