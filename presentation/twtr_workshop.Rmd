## Who am I?

Resul Umit

- post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oslo

- interested in representation, elections, and parliaments
    - [a recent publication](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1478929920967588):
    Parliamentary communication allowances do not increase electoral turnout or incumbentsâ€™ vote share. 

--

- working with Twitter data
    - [a publication based on Twitter data](https://doi.org/10.1080/13572334.2017.1283166): The voices of Eurosceptic members of parliament (MPs) echo disproportionately louder on Twitter.
    
      - 400,000+ tweets from 1,000+ MPs
      - automated classification, using a bag-of-words approach
      - manual validation
      
    - [an app based on Twitter data](https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/likewise/): LikeWise &mdash; an app that facilitates searching the tweets that you liked.

--

- more information available at [resulumit.com](https://resulumit.com/)

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Overview

- Two days, on how to collect, process, and analyse data from Twitter

  - 200+ slides, 40+ exercises, and time for working on a real project

--

- Based on converting a mock manuscript written in Word to R Markdown

  - plus, improving its reproducibility and version-controlling it
  - with a PDF output in mind

--

- Designed for researchers with basic knowledge of R programming language

  - does not cover programming with R
      - e.g., writing functions    
<br>
  - existing ability to work with data in R will be very helpful
      - but not absolutely necessary &mdash; this ability can be developed during and after the workshop as well
        
---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation

- Twitter provides attractive opportunities for academic research

  - a simple search for "twitter data" returns 55,000+ results on Google Scholar, at the end of 2020

--

- Research based on Twitter data requires a set of skills 

  - typically, these skills are not part of academic training


---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Opportunities

- Popularity of the network

  - about 350 million users, more than half are daily active
  - your subjects are likely Twitter users
     - e.g., for me, members of parliament

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Opportunities

- Popularity of the network

  - about 350 million users, more than half are daily active<sup>*</sup>
  - your subjects are likely Twitter users
     - e.g., for me, members of parliament

- Richness of the data

  - about 500 million tweets per day<sup>*</sup>
  - with up to 90 variables for each tweet


.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> These statistics are compiled at the end of 2020, by [BusinessOfApps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitter-statistics).

## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Opportunities

- Popularity of the network

  - about 350 million users, more than half are daily active
  - your subjects are likely Twitter users
     - e.g., for me, members of parliament

- Richness of the data

  - about 500 million tweets per day
  - with up to 90 variables for each tweet

- Accessibility of the data

  - most Twitter data are public
     - i.e., relatively few private profiles
  - programmatic access to Twitter is enabled
     - through API (application programming interface)

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Challenges

- Research based on Twitter data requires certain skills

  - e.g., availability of API is meaningless for researchers who cannot write code yet
  - processing and analysing are no less challenging without programming skills

--

- The required skills are often uncovered in the academic training of social scientists

  - e.g., methodology courses
  - but help is available elsewhere
      - collaborate with researchers with the skills
         - sacrificing some control over your research and research agenda
      - acquire the skills through individual effort
         - e.g., workshops such as this one

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Aims

- To provide you with an understanding of what is possible

  - we will cover a large breath of issues, not all of it is for long-term memory
      - one reason why the slides are designed for self study as well    
<br>
  - awareness of what is possible, `Google`, and perseverance are all we need

--

- To start you with acquiring and practicing the skills needed 

  - practice with ready-written code
  - start working on a real project

- setting the workshop up
    - e.g., installing R 
    
- completing the exercises
    - e.g., downloading tweets
    - there are 40+ exercises
    - these slides have countdown timers
        - as a guide, not to be followed strictly
    
`r countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---

    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

- Results that come out in output files .out-t[appear as such &mdash; in the same font, on green background]
    - except very obvious results, such as figures and tables
    
--
    
- Specific sections are .yellow-h[highlighted yellow as such] for emphasis
    - these could be for anything &mdash; codes and texts in input, results in output, and/or texts on slides
    
--

- The slides are designed for self-study as much as for the workshop
    - *accessible*, in substance and form, to go through on your own

# Part 1. Before You Start

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Considerations &mdash; Reseach Questions & Hypotheses

- Ideally, we already have one or more research questions, hypotheses
  - developed prior to data collection on Twitter and analysis
     - based on, e.g., theory, claims, observations
  - perhaps, even pre-registered
     - e.g., at [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries)

--

- Not all questions can be answered with Twitter data
  - see relevant literature for what works, what does not
     - e.g., for political science, the review by [Jungherr (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19331681.2015.1132401)
     - e.g., for public health, the review by [Sinnenberg et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303512)

---


## Considerations &mdash; Potential Biases

There are two potential sources of bias in Twitter data

- sampling

  - Twitter users are not representative of the people out there
     - see, for example, [Mellon and Prosser (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2053168017720008)
  - Tweeting behaviour has a strategic component 
     - see, for example, [Umit (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/13572334.2017.1283166)


--
name: potential-biases

- mediation

  - the behaviour on Twitter is mediated through written and unwritten rules
     - e.g., the function to like, but no dislike
       - does this systematically bias the replies towards negative?
     - e.g., the common use of the like function as a bookmark
       - what would a study of likes measure?

---
## Considerations &mdash; Constraints over Data Access

- Twitter has restrictions on data access

  - how much data can you download through API
     - how quickly, frequently, how far dating back, *etc*.

--

- These restrictions vary from one operation to another, a lot!

  - e.g., collecting tweets in real time *vs*. collecting historical tweets
     - but also, collecting historical tweets from a specific user *vs*. tweets from any user

--

- Twitter might change the rules of the game at any anytime

  - making these restrictions more or less stricter
     - e.g., while you are in the middle of data collection
    

---
## Considerations &mdash; Constraints over Data Redistribution

- Twitter restricts content redistribution

   - only Tweet IDs can be made publicly available in datasets
      - not tweets themselves
 - see [Twitter Developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy) for further details

--
 
- Reproducibility of research based on Twitter data is limited in practice

  - i.e., reproducibility after publication, by others
  - technically, they can retrieve the tweets with IDs
      - in practice, this is very demanding, and may even be impossible
          - e.g., tweets, or whole accounts, might be deleted

---
## Considerations &mdash; Changes in the Twitter API

- Twitter is currently switching to a new API

  - replacing API v1 with API v2
  - see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access

--

- Existing codes to collect tweets may or may not be affected, depending on

   - how the API v2 will look in the end
       - it is still a work in progress
   - whether and how the `rtweet` package<sup>*</sup> will adopt
   
   
.footnote[

<sup>*<sup> This is the R package that we will use to collect tweets. More details are in [Part 2](#part2).

## Considerations &mdash; Changes in the Twitter API

- Twitter is currently switching to a new API

  - replacing API v1 with API v2
  - see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access


- Existing codes to collect tweets may or may not be affected, depending on

   - how the API v2 will look in the end
       - it is still a work in progress
   - whether and how the `rtweet` package will adopt


- Not all changes are bad

   - among others, API v2 promises
       - 'to serve the unique needs and challenges of academic researchers'
           - see https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research
       - unlimited access to all public tweets

---
## Considerations &mdash; Law and Ethics

- For most research designs, it is impossible to get users' consent to collect and analyze their twitter data
    
  - Twitter itself has no problem with it, but others may disagree
      - e.g., your country, (funding) institution, subjects
    
--
    
- Check the rules that apply to your case
   
  - is it legal in your country?
  - does your institution allow it? 
  
--

- Reflect on whether using Twitter data for research is ethical

  - even where it is legal and allowed, it may not be moral

---
## Considerations &mdash; Data Storage

Twitter data might require 

- large amounts of digital storage space

  - typically big data
      - many tweets, variables
  - e.g., a dataset of 1M tweets requires about 250MB 
      - when stored in .Rdata format

--

- private, safe storage spaces

  - due to [Twitter Developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)
  - but also local laws, institutional requirements

---
## Considerations &mdash; Language and Context

- Some tools of analysis are developed for a specific language and context

   - e.g., dictionaries for sentiment analysis, 
       - e.g., in English, for political texts
   - these may not be useful, valid for different languages, and context
   
--

- Some tools of analysis are developed for general context

   - e.g., a dictionary for sentiment analysis in general
   - these may not be useful, valid for a specific context
      - e.g., political science

## R &mdash; Download from the Internet and Install

- Programming language of this workshop
  - created for data analysis, extending for other purposes
      - e.g., accessing APIs
  - allows for all three steps in one environment
      - collecting, processing, and analysing Twitter data
  - an alternative: [python](https://www.python.org/)
  
- Optional, if you have R already installed
  - consider updating if it is not up to date
    - type the `R.version.string` command in R to check the version of your copy
    - compare with the latest official release at [https://cran.r-project.org/sources.html](https://cran.r-project.org/sources.html)

- Download R from [https://cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)
    - choose the version for your operating system

---
class: action

## RStudio &mdash; Download from the Internet and Install

- Optional, but highly recommended
  - facilitates working with Twitter data in R

- A popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R
  - an alternative: [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

- Download RStudio from [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download)
  - choose the free version
  - consider updating if it is not up to date, following from the RStudio menu:

> `Help -> Check for Updates`

---
class: action
name: rstudio-project

## RStudio Project &mdash; Create from within RStudio 

- RStudio allows for dividing your work with R into separate projects

  - each project gets dedicated workspace, history, and source documents

  - [this page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) has more information on why projects are recommended

<br>

- Create a new RStudio project from the RStudio menu:

> `File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project`

---
class: action

## R Packages &mdash; Install from within RStudio

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages(c("rtweet", "httpuv", "tidytext", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))

```

--

- `rtweet` ([Kearney, 2020](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/index.html)), for collecting tweets
    - alternatives: used to be `twitteR` ([Gentry, 2015](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html)), but not anymore; running Python in R
    
--

- `httpuv` ([Cheng & Chang, 2020](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httpuv/index.html)), for API authorization
    - alternative: using your own access tokens
        - necessitates making an application through a developer
        - has advantages that we will discuss later on

--

- `tidytext` ([Robinson & Silge, 2021](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html)), for working with text as data
    - alternative: e.g., `quenteda` (Benoit et al., 2020)
--

- `dplyr` ([Wickham et al., 2020a](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)), for data manipulation
    - alternatives: e.g., `base`, `data.table` ([Dowle & Srinivasan, 2020](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html))

--
    
- `ggplot2` ([Wickham et al., 2020b](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)), for plotting data
    - alternatives: e.g., `base`, `plotly` ([Sievert et al., 2020](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html))

---
class: action

## Twitter &mdash; Open an Account

Sign up for Twitter at [https://twitter.com/](twitter.com)

- a pre-condition for interacting with the Twitter API
    - for both authentication methods
        - i.e., through the `rtweet` and `httpuv` packages, or your personal access tokens

--

- helpful for getting to know what you study
    - e.g., the written and unwritten rules that mediate the behaviour on Twitter
        - as discussed [in Part 1](#potential-biases)

--

- with a strategic username
  - usernames are changeable, but nevertheless public
      - either choose an anonymous username (e.g., `asdf029348`)
      - or choose one carefully &mdash; they become a part of users' online presence

    - e.g., historical tweets from all users, including a word
        - up to 18,000 tweets
        - posted up to seven to nine days prior to search
    
    - e.g., historical tweets from a given user
        - up to 3,200 most recent tweets
