## Who am I?

Resul Umit

- post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oslo

- interested in representation, elections, and parliaments
    - [a recent publication](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1478929920967588):
    Parliamentary communication allowances do not increase electoral turnout or incumbentsâ€™ vote share.

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Overview

- Two days, on how to collect, process, and analyse data from Twitter

  - 200+ slides, 40+ exercises, and time for working on a real project

--

- Based on converting a mock manuscript written in Word to R Markdown

  - plus, improving its reproducibility and version-controlling it
  - with a PDF output in mind

--

- Designed for researchers with basic knowledge of R programming language

  - does not cover programming with R
      - e.g., writing functions    
<br>
  - existing ability to work with data in R will be very helpful
      - but not absolutely necessary &mdash; this ability can be developed during and after the workshop as well

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation

- Sit in groups of two

  - participants learn as much from their partner as from instructors
  - switch partners after every part

- Type, rather than copy and paste, the code that you will find on these slides

  - typing is a part of the learning process

- When you have a question

  - ask your partner
  - google together
  - ask me

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

Slides with this background colour indicate that your action is required, for

- setting the workshop up
    - e.g., installing R 
    
- completing the exercises
    - e.g., managing references in R Markdown
    - there are 40+ exercises
    - these slides have countdown timers
    
`r countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

- Codes and texts that go in R Markdown documents .inline-c[appear as such &mdash; in a different font, on gray background]
    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

```{r, demonstration, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = h5_median, y = h5_index, color = subfield)) +
       geom_point() +
       facet_wrap(. ~ branch) +
       scale_colour_discrete(name = "Journal Type", breaks = c(0, 1), labels = c("Generalist", "Subfield"))    

```

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

- Codes and texts that go in R Markdown documents .inline-c[appear as such &mdash; in a different font, on gray background]
    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

- Results that come out in output files .out-t[appear as such &mdash; in the same font, on green background]
    - except very obvious results, such as figures and tables
    
--
    
- Specific sections are .yellow-h[highlighted yellow as such] for emphasis
    - these could be for anything &mdash; codes and texts in input, results in output, and/or texts on slides
    
--

- The slides are designed for self-study as much as for the workshop
    - *accessible*, in substance and form, to go through on your own

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Aims

- To make you aware what is possible with R Markdown

  - we will cover a large breath of issues, not all of it is for long-term memory
      - one reason why the slides are designed for self study as well    
<br>
  - awareness of what is possible, `Google`, and perseverance are all we need

--

- To encourage you to convert into R Markdown 

  - practice with a mock manuscript (Parts 3&ndash;9)
  - start converting a real one (Part 10)

## RStudio Project &mdash; Create from within RStudio 

- RStudio allows for dividing your work with R into separate projects, each with own history etc.

  - [this page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) has more information on why projects are recommended

<br>

- Create a new RStudio project for the existing<sup>*</sup> workshop directory `...\YOURNAME-rmd` from the RStudio menu:

> `File -> New Project -> Existing Directory -> Browse -> ...\YOURNAME-rmd -> Open`
